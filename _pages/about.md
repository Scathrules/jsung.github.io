I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and a minor in geology from Tulane University in May 2020. I then earned a Master of Science in applied mathematics from Tulane University in May 2021. 

In my free time, I love doing outdoor activities, learning about history, playing my guitar, and spending time with my friends!
