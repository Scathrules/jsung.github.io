Welcome! My name is Junhyup Sung but I go by Eric. I primarily work in mathematics and physics. To see my current and past research, check out my [research section](_pages/research.md).

I am currently working with <a href = "https://bondar.tulane.edu/" target = "_blank">Dr. Denys Bondar</a> on open quantum systems and entropic gravity. Our paper is set to appear on arXiv before February.
